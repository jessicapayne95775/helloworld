# Overview

This is the first project in Python to demonstrate basic display functionality. By displaying the "Hello World" statement, it is a starting building block of the language. 

This program will display "Hello World" in the terminal to the user when the program is ran.

I created this project to set up my version control system and integrated development environment to ensure they are functioning.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with Python as my integrated development environment to develop this program. My version control system that I am using is Git and Github.

I used Python for the simplicity of the print statement to display the "Hello World."
